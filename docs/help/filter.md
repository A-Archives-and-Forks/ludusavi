# Filter
You can click the filter icon at the top of the backup/restore screens to use some filters.
Note that this only affects which games you see in the list,
but Ludusavi will still back up the full set of games.

You can apply filters for the following:

* Whether the game title matches a search.
* Whether multiple games have the same save files:
  * `Unique` (no conflicts)
  * `Duplicated` (conflicts exist)
* Whether all save files for a game are enabled for processing:
  * `Complete` (all saves enabled)
  * `Partial` (some saves disabled)
* Whether the game itself is enabled for processing:
  * `Enabled` (checkbox next to game is checked)
  * `Disabled` (checkbox next to game is unchecked)
